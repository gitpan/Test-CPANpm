Revision history for Perl extension Test::CPANpm.

    - Fix STDIN/STDOUT redirection "once and for all"; we now use the lowest
      common denominator: obtaining "fileno" on a filehandle and redirecting
      to that. This should work as early as perl 5.005, and should work
      equally well on UNIX, Win32, Amiga, and Commodore 64. Thanks to
      Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@activestate.com> for his help with this one.

    - If there isn't a CPAN::Config yet, get CPAN to generate one for us.
      I'm toying with the idea of making our own CPAN::Config whether or not
      there is one (to prevent permissions problems on cpan_home, etc) -
      might do that next release.
    - Removed dependancy on Test::Deep. Instead, we just depend on Test::More
      now.
    - perl 5.6.1 doesn't support "open(FOO, ">&", $foo)", so use
      open(FOO, ">&$foo") instead.

    - Got rid of unititialized value errors
    - Use tempfile() instead of /dev/null - Should make this work on non-UNIXes
    - Don't close STDIN, redirect it from a tempfile instead
      (gets rid of 'STDIN reopened for output' warning)

    - Hopefully fixed CPAN testers failures:
      Jost was using a newer version of CPAN.pm than me (1.87, I was on 1.7601),
      and this new version requires that 'archive' and 'unwrapped' need to be
      set.

    - Another "debug Jost Krieger's Smokehouse" release:
        - Depends on CPAN.pm now
        - When debugging is on, print out what version of CPAN we are using.
    - Update year number on change history :-)

    - made logging on unit tests a bit better so I can see why some CPAN
      testers aren't passing
